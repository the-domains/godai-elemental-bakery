We specialise in slow fermentation sourdough breads, made using traditional methods and just a few simple ingredients; flour, water, sea salt and naturally occurring yeast. 

All our sourdoughs are hand made over two days, baked on stone, and use organic flour and other wholesome ingredients including nuts, seeds, grains and dried fruit. As well as our newly opened cafe and shop, we supply retailers, restaurants and caf√©s with bread 6 days a week, as well as doing farmers markets at the weekends. 

Our Peckham Rye was the holder of of the Real Bread Campaign's London Loaf from 2012-2014, we have won several awards including best baguette at World Bread Awards, we are listed as one of only three bakeries in

[Monocle Magazine's London][0][travel guide][0], and were recently named as one of the[UK's 20 best bakeries in The Telegraph][1].
