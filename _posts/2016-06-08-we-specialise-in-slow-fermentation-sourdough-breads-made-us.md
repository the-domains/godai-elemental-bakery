We specialise in slow fermentation sourdough breads, made using traditional methods and just a few simple ingredients; flour, water, sea salt and naturally occurring yeast. 

All our sourdoughs are hand made over two days, baked on stone, and use organic flour and other wholesome ingredients including nuts, seeds, grains and dried fruit.
