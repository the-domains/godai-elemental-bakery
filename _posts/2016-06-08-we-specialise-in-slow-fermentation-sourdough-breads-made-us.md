The Godai (五大) Elemental Bakery bakes sourdough bread Monday to Saturday.  
We specialise in slow fermentation sourdough breads, made using traditional methods and just a few simple ingredients; flour, water, sea salt and naturally occurring yeast. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c226254-f438-48af-a059-71ec6be67f38.jpg)

All our sourdoughs are hand made over two days, baked on stone, and use organic flour and other wholesome ingredients including nuts, seeds, grains and dried fruit.
