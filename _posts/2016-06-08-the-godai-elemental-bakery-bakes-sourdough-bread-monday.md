The Godai (五大) Elemental Bakery bakes sourdough bread Monday to Saturday. 

We bake using flour, water, the natural yeasts in the air and sea salt. 

Godai is based on the five elements philosophy in Japanese Buddhism -- Earth, Water, Fire Wind and Void. 

We have no idea where the energy comes from to raise our dough. It's the most magical element of all.
